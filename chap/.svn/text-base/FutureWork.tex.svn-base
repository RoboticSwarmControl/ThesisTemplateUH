\end{figure}

This dissertation applied the framework of ensemble control theory to derive approximate steering algorithms for two classical robotic systems under bounded model perturbation.  We applied this same framework for feedback control of a multi-robot system where every robot receives exactly the same control input.  We validated our approach on each system with the hardware experiments shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:threeMotivationalProblemsF}.

%This research led to results that were surprising to us. These include that a unicycle with unknown wheel size can be steered from one Cartesian position to another without feedback, that spheres of varying sizes can be simultaneously reoriented without feedback, and that a collection of identical differential-drive robots with a common control input can be simultaneously steered to a desired position.  
This research provides many promising avenues for future work. Outlined below are opportunities related to control of many differential-drive robots, control of many balls with a plate-ball manipulator, and feedback control of canonical ensemble control systems.

\subsubsection{\emph{Feedback Control of Many Differential-Drive Robots}}

 We demonstrated position control and trajectory following with this multi-robot system. 
  The planar control law we provided could be extended to three dimensions for swimming and flying robots with the addition of a second input for rotation.
  Another useful approach may be to treat each robot as a finger for manipulating objects in a planar workspace.  These fingers could be used for object alignment, transport, form closure, and assembly.  Although we showed that the orientation of each robot in the ensemble is not controllable, this limitation does not apply to the objects being manipulated.  Provided the object to be manipulated is larger than the individual robots, the ensemble can apply arbitrary forces and torques to steer objects along trajectories in $SE(2)$. Possible applications include targeted therapy, material removal, assembly, and telemetry for remote sensing.
 
 Moreover, the final orientation of each robot is easy to compute.  By assigning desired ending positions as a function of the final orientation, the ensemble can be steered to control the final orientation of the robots relative to a fixed object.  This could enable the robots to surround a target and deliver material or to construct a boundary.  %TODO: draw picture.

We proved that a finite ensemble of differential-drive robots is globally asymptotically stable. %This result enables several lines of inquiry.
 Our simulations indicate that it may be possible to prove the stronger result  that our feedback policy provides exponential convergence of a finite ensemble.

Finally, the requirements for our control policy are modest.  We showed that the policy applies even to robots with non-negative linear and angular velocities and minimum turning radii.    This work may be particularly relevant to systems of micro- and nano-robots, which are often constrained to uniform inputs.  Applying this policy to a micro- or nano-robotic system would demonstrate if this approach is practical.  
Additionally, our analysis of behavior under uncertainty provided insight on which tolerances are helpful for control and which are detrimental.  This may prove helpful for the engineers who design these robots.  

%As a first step to micro-robot implementation, we have constructed self-assembled magnetic swimmers \cite{Carlos-Orduno2012,Orduno2012} with the setup shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hardwareSetupMag}.  
%Recent work has shown that a suspension of ferro-magnetic micro-particles (45$\mu$m) will form a large-scale structure when exposed to an alternating magnetic field that is oriented perpendicular to the liquid surface \cite{Snezhko2006,Belkin2007,Snezhko2009}. This structure becomes mobile and turns into a self-assembled robotic ``swimmer'' when symmetry is broken by adding a larger non-magnetic bead (1mm). The motion of this swimmer is unidirectional, generally toward the bead that forms the head. Changes in frequency of the alternating magnetic field (30-40Hz) cause changes in the arrangement and characteristic length of the swimmer, which in turn change the surrounding flow and affect subsequent motion.
%
%We show that multiple swimmers can self-assemble simultaneously. We model each self-assembled robotic swimmer as a nonholonomic unicycle, under the constraint that it only moves forward. Each swimmer has unique velocity and turning rates that can be learned experimentally.  We can then model the collection of swimmers by \eqref{eq:ensembleFeedbackDD}. This system shows promise as another testbed for ensemble control techniques.

\subsubsection{\emph{Feedback Control of Many Spheres with a Plate-Ball Manipulator}}

We designed piecewise-constant input trajectories to move a sphere between start and goal configurations in $\R^2 \times SO(3)$  despite an unknown sphere radius.  This is a case-study for robotic-manipulation.

 On a different scale, the results in this dissertation may find application in a manufacturing environment where an  industrial robot manipulates many parts in parallel.  In particular, the control-Lyapunov approach in Chapter \ref{chap:FeedbackControlDiffDrive} for differential-drive robots could be applied to manipulating many spheres.  % by the orientation of a specific point on each sphere.  
 Preliminary results with spheres painted with one hemisphere black and the other hemisphere white indicate similar convergence properties as in Chapter \ref{chap:FeedbackControlDiffDrive}.
 
Finally, the optimized paths for the plate-ball problem in Chapter \ref{chap:ApproxPlate-BallSteering} only searched a limited space of $n$ interleaved $x$- and $y$-axis rotations.  This search returned a local minimum.   The optimal shortest-length paths for a single ball are in general smooth curves.  Future work could apply optimal control tools (perhaps pseudospectral optimization \cite{Rao2010}) to construct better paths with guarantees of optimality.
  
 \subsubsection{\emph{Opportunities in Ensemble Control} }
For the purposes of this dissertation we restricted ourselves to three robotic systems.  There are many other classical systems that can be shown to be ensemble controllable, e.g. a mass-spring-damper system with unknown parameters, planar bodies with thrusters with unknown thruster power/position, and the general problem of rolling bodies in contact.

Lastly, the feedback control law presented in this dissertation has a simple form that is easy to compute.  It may be possible to apply similar feedback control techniques to ensemble control problems outside of robotics.
