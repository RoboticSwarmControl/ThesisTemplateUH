%The Preliminary Examination is intended to test the validity of the thesis proposal and the candidate's fitness to carry out the research work proposed. It begins with a short presentation by the candidate, outlining the problem chosen, the procedures and methods to be used, the work already completed, and a proposal for the additional work to be completed for the PhD degree. The committee then questions the candidate regarding the problem, the preliminary results, and the proposed work. The candidate may be asked to clarify matters in the thesis proposal and to defend various aspects of the work already completed or the work being proposed. The committee may suggest alternative methods of attacking the problem or suggest different aspects of the problem as suitable areas for exploration. The committee also may ask questions of a more general nature in order to test the adequacy of the candidate's preparation for the proposed research.

All robots face problems with uncertainty, both from unmodeled dynamics and parameter uncertainty.  In the course of my graduate career at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign we have applied 
various techniques to achieve task objectives. 

Instead of attempting to robustly control systems with uncertain parameters, ensemble control attempts to reframe such problems as severely under-actuated systems where the control input is applied to \emph{every}  system that could be generated by the uncertain parameter.
%In this work, we frame systems with parameter 


\subsection{Control under noise and unmodeled dynamics}
State estimation is complicated by nonlinear, noisy sensor measurements and unmodeled dynamics.

My master's thesis work \cite{Becker2008} began with a human-sized robot that rode a Segway mobility platform.  This robot was unable to \emph{localize} (estimate the state variables of position and orientation) itself because its state estimate drifted as the robot moved.  Our solution was to build a non-parametric sensor model generated from a map of Wi-Fi signal strength.  This allowed the robot to approximate optimal estimation through bayesian inference, implemented both with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a particle filter, the robot could maintain an accurate state estimate as it patrolled hallways.

% Control with underactuation Manipulation with airflow
In \cite{Becker2009} we presented a mechanism and a control
strategy that enabled automated non-contact manipulation of
spherical objects in three dimensions using air flow, and demonstrated
several tasks that can be performed with such a system.
The mechanism was a 2-DOF gimbaled air jet with a variable
flow rate. 

Two key control challenges are presented by this type of manipulation, in
contrast to traditional robotic manipulation with a mechanical
gripper. First, the dynamics of the flow field itself are difficult
to model. These dynamics are typically governed by systems
of partial differential equations and may exhibit behavior that
is both uncertain and chaotic. Second, the dynamics of the
manipulated objects are strongly coupled, since the presence
of an object in a flow field changes the structure of that field
for other objects.

The control strategy was feedback linearization based
on a classical fluid dynamics model with state estimates from
stereo vision data. The tasks included palletizing, sorting, and
ballistics. All results were verified with hardware experiments.  A youtube video of the experiment achieved best of youtube status.

Biomedical devices present special challenges in sensing and actuation.  The gait lab at the University of Illinois has developed an Powered Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO), an orthotic devices used to correct gait deficiencies created by impairments to the lower limbs.   We modeled the Ankle Foot Orthosis as a robot with a single actuator.  The control is dependent on the state of the system, a single cyclic value called the percent gait cycle. The gait cycle is only quasi-periodic due to unmodeled dynamics caused by the human-in-the-loop and terrain interactions.   The multiple sensors in the system are not adequate to uniquely identify the state.   As in  \cite{Becker2008}, our solution began with learning sensor models. Our approach used cross correlation between a window of past measurements and the learned sensor models to estimate the configuration of the human walker, and detected gait events based on this estimate \cite{David-Yifan-Li2011}.



The classical problem of robot coverage is to plan a path that brings a point on the robot within a fixed distance of every point in the free space. In the presence of significant uncertainty in sensing and actuation, it may no longer be possible to guarantee that the robot covers all of the free space all the time, and so it becomes unclear what problem we are trying to solve. We will restore clarity by adopting a ``probably approximately correct'' measure of performance that captures the probability $1-\veps$ of covering a fraction $1-\delta$ of the free space \cite{Das2011}. The problem of coverage for a robot with uncertainty is then to plan a feedback policy that achieves a given value of $\veps$ and $\delta$. Just as solutions to the classical problem are judged by the resulting path length, solutions to our problem are judged by the required execution time. We will show the practical utility of our performance measure by applying it to several examples in simulation.

\subsection{Control under parameter uncertainty}
The approach in \cite{Becker2008,Becker2009,David-Yifan-Li2011,Das2011} was to apply state estimation techniques to regulate against or filter out disturbances. Both techniques could be applied when system parameters themselves are uncertain if the necessary sensors measurements could be obtained.  Often, however these sensor measurements do not exist.  

%Optimal Control during search and return
In \cite{Pablo2010} we examined the linear search problem for a robot with dynamics.  We derived the control policy that
minimizes the total expected time for a point mass with bounded
acceleration, starting from the origin at rest, to find and return
to an unknown target that is distributed uniformly on the unit
interval. 
In this problem, the  target location is an unknown parameter. Were this parameter known, the optimal solution is a bang-bang type acceleration profile that terminates on the target.  
We applied our result to proof-of-concept hardware
experiments with a planar robot arm searching for a metal
object using an inductive proximity sensor. In particular, we
showed that our approach easily extends to optimal search along
arbitrary curves, such as raster-scan patterns that might be
useful in other applications like robot search-and-rescue.

% Ensemble Control
In \cite{Becker2010,Becker2011}
% we considered the problem of motion planning
%for a nonholonomic unicycle despite uncertainty that scales
%both the forward speed and the turning rate by an unknown but
%bounded constant. We model the unicycle as an ensemble control
%system, show that the position of this ensemble is controllable, and
%derive motion planning algorithms to steer this position between
%a given start and goal. We apply our work to a differential-drive
%robot with unknown but bounded wheel radius, and validate our
%approach with hardware experiments.
%\cite{Becker2011}
we  considered the problem of steering a
nonholonomic unicycle despite model perturbation that scales
both the forward speed and the turning rate by an unknown but
bounded constant. We modeled the unicycle as an ensemble control
system, showed that this system is ensemble controllable, and derived
an approximate steering algorithm that brings the unicycle to
within an arbitrarily small neighborhood of any given Cartesian
position. We applied our work to a differential-drive robot with
unknown but bounded wheel radius, and validated our approach
with hardware experiments.

%\subsection{Robotic Coverage}
%The material presented in \cite{Das2011} was briefly discussed.  It should be amplified with new experiments, especially a comparison between  multi-robot teams and single robot solutions.  A journal article explaining the PAC metric and robotic coverage should be part of the PhD degree.


\subsection{Velocity Constraints and Ensemble Controllability}
In our TRO paper \cite{Becker2011} we considered the kinematic unicycle with bounded parameter perturbation $\epsilon$,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ensemble}
\dot{q}(t,\epsilon) = \epsilon \bigl( g_1\left( q(t,\epsilon) \right) u_1(t) + g_2\left( q(t,\epsilon) \right) u_2(t) \bigr),
\end{equation}
where 
\[
g_1(q) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta\\ \sin\theta\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\qquad\qquad
g_2(q) = \begin{bmatrix}  0\\ 0\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
are vector fields that correspond to the linear and angular velocity inputs.
 We proved that any set of linear and angular velocity inputs $(u_1,u_2)$ whose affine hull spanned the origin were sufficient for approximately steering a kinematic unicycle in $\R^2$.
 
 Via the LARC condition and polynomial approximation, we proved approximate controllability.
 
 Moreover, we showed that the set of inputs $\{(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)\}$ were sufficient to steer the unicycle within $\mu$ if a goal in $\R^2$ if $\mu>0$.  We also provided a motion planning algorithm for this steering task.
 
 Unfortunately, our motivating problem, the \emph{scratch-drive robots} designed and built by Donald et al. \cite{Donald2006,Donald2008}, can only provide the inputs $\{(0,1),(1,0)\}$.  Since the affine hull of these inputs does not span the origin, the LARC condition guarantees only small-time local accessibility (SMLA), and not the small-time local controllability (STLC) sufficient to prove global controllability.  To prove global controllability, we must instead provide a constructive algorithm that, under the restricted set of inputs, can steer the ensemble within $\mu$ of a goal location in $\R^2$.
 
\subsection{Feedback Control of Robotic Ensembles}
Open-loop ensemble control is robust to parametric uncertainty, but cannot reject drift in the state estimate.  For this dissertation, we will expand ensemble control results and implement closed-loop feedback control of an ensemble.
 
\subsection{Sensorless Part Manipulation}

Ensemble control techniques may have a niche in manufacturing processes.
They require few sensors and actuators, but can be remarkably robust to certain types of parametric uncertainty. 
 These techniques should be demonstrated with a prototype manufacturing process.  To make progress, for this dissertation we will develop an experimental platform that can automatically reorient multiple spheres of varying radii robustly with a single actuator.
